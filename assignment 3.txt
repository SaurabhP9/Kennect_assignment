   SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) / COUNT(matches_played) AS strike_rate
FROM player_stats GROUP BY player_name;

2.Player's avg run-rate:

   SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) / SUM(overs_played) AS avg_run_rate

LIMIT 3;
   
4.Couple of teams who have played most matches with each-other:

   SELECT team1, team2, COUNT(*) as matches_played FROM matches GROUP BY team1, team2
ORDER BY matches_played DESC LIMIT 2;

5.Given two teams as input, success rate of Team1 against Team2:

   WITH team_wins AS (
    SELECT team1, COUNT(*) as wins
    FROM matches
    WHERE team1 = 'Team1' AND team2 = 'Team2' AND team1_score > team2_score

    GROUP BY team1
  )
  SELECT team_wins.wins / team_matches.total_matches as success_rate
  FROM team_wins
  JOIN team_matches
  ON team_wins.team1 = team_matches.team1


6.Players who played the most matches in a specific year:

     SELECT player_name, COUNT(DISTINCT match_date) as matches_played
  FROM player_stats WHERE match_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'

    GROUP BY team1
  )
  SELECT team_wins.team1 as team, team_wins.wins / team_matches.total_matches as success_rate
